# Multivariable-Control-and-the-Quadruple-Tank-Process-Lab
This project analyzes feedback control design for MIMO systems, focusing on proportional (P) and proportional-integral (PI) controllers applied to the quadruple-tank process. The system exhibits significant cross-coupling, complicating independent output control. A static decoupling matrix, derived from the steady-state inverse transfer function, is used to minimize these interactions. Simulink simulations show that while the P controller offers fast responses, it causes oscillations and steady-state errors. The PI controller improves accuracy and stability, and when combined with decoupling, it significantly reduces cross-coupling effects, enabling independent control and enhancing overall system performance.
